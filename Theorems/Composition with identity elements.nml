Theorem (GroupCompositionWithIdentityElements)
  Suppose
    g is an element of 𝒢
    o is an operation of 𝒢
    e is an identity element of 𝒢
  Then
    g o e = g = e o g
  Proof
    e is an element of 𝒢 by GroupIdentityElementsAreElements
    e is an identity element of 𝒢 𝘪𝘧𝘧 [𝒢, o, e] satisfies GroupIdentity by GroupIdentityElement
    e is an identity element of 𝒢
    [𝒢, o, e] satisfies GroupIdentity by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    Therefore
      g o e = g = e o g because [𝒢, o, e] satisfies GroupIdentity

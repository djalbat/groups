Axiom [𝒢, o] (GroupClosure)
  Suppose 
    f is an element of 𝒢
    g is an element of 𝒢
  Then
    g o f is an element of 𝒢

Axiom [𝒢, o] (GroupAssociativity)
  Suppose 
    f is an element of 𝒢
    g is an element of 𝒢
    h is an element of 𝒢
  Then
    h o (g o f) = (h o g) o f = h o g o f

Axiom (GroupOperation)

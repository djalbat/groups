Variable G:Group provisionally

Variable o:Operation

Variable e:Element 
Variable g:Element 

Axiom [G, o, e, g] (GroupIdentityElement)
  Suppose 
    o is an operation of G
    e is an element of G
    g is an element of G
  Then
    g o e = g = e o g

Axiom [G, o, e] (GroupIdentityElements)
  Suppose
    e is an identity element of G
  Then
   [G, o, e, g] satisfies GroupIdentityElement

Axiom (GroupIdentityElementsAreElements)
  Suppose
    e is an identity element of G
  Then
    e is an element of G

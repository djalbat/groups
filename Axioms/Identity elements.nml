Satisfiable Axiom (GroupIdentityElement)
  Suppose 
    e is an element of G
    o is an operation of G
    g is an element of G
  Then
    g o e = g = e o g

Axiom (IdentityElementsAreElements)
  Suppose
    e is an identity element of G
  Then
    e is an element of G

Axiom (IdentityElements)
  e, o, G satisfy GroupIdentityElement iff e is an identity element of G

Variable f
Variable g
Variable h

Variable G:Group
Variable o:Operation

Axiom (Closure)
  Suppose 
    g is an element of G
    h is an element of G
  Then
    g o h is an element of G

Axiom (Associativity)
  Suppose 
    f is an element of G
    g is an element of G
    h is an element of G
  Then
    f o (g o h) = (f o g) o h = f o g o h

Axiom (GroupOperation)
  Suppose 
    o, G satisfy Closure
    o, G satisfy Associativity
  Then
    o is an operation of G
